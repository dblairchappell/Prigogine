Prigogine is a domain-specific language and development environment for scientists wanting to develop large-scale agent-based models but lacking the knowledge neccessary to take advantage of high-performance computing technology. By utilising Python's multiprocessing module and the NumPy package for n-dimensional arrays, it is hoped that the performance capabilities of modelling frameworks such as Repast HPC and FLAME, and the productiveness of high-levels languages such as NetLogo, can be matched in one convenient package.

The project is at a relatively early stage and is presently focussed on getting single-core functionality up and running. The target timeframe for getting the first version released is mid-september 2015.
