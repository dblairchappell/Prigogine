Prigogine aims to be a new scripting language for non-profesisonal programmers who want to develop high performance agent-based models. The motivation behind this project is the lack of multicore/HPC functionality in the current crop of entry-level ABM tools. The hope is that by utilising the Julia programming language as a base upon which to build a new language, the type of multiprocessor functionality found in ABM frameworks such as FLAME and Repast HPC can be made available to modellers who are not professional programmers.

The project is currently at a very early stage and, as such, is presently focussed on getting single-core functionality up and running. The target timeframe for getting the first multicore version released is mid-september 2015.
